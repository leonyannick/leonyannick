# About me

Although I have always been fascinated by computers it needed some randomness before I could fall in love with coding. During covid, by chance, I signed up for Harvards [CS50: Introduction to Computer Science](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science). Discovering my passion for coding through the course I decided to wrap up my bachelor program in chemical engineering by writing a thesis that inovolved coding. After completing my degree, unsure of what to pursue next, I stumbled upon school 42 ([42 Berlin](https://42berlin.de/)) and its different approach of teaching programming. This leads me to where I am now: about to finish school 42's core curriculum and looking for a job, project or internship to further deepen my understanding of computers, continue learning more, and maybe even contribute to something meaningful...
