# About me

Trying to make computers do what I want them to. A journey that started in 2021 after completing Harvards [CS50: Introduction to Computer Science](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science). Other steps on the way: completing my engineering degree with a coding thesis and 1.5 years of coding school, 42 Berlin. Currently doing an internship with CertHub as a Fullstack-Developer, working with React, TanStack, MongoDB and FastAPI.
